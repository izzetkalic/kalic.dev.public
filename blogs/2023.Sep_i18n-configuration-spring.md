# Decoding i18n Challenges in Spring Boot 3: Exploring Internationalization

Even though localization/internationalization (also known as i18n) may seem simple, it can sometimes become confusing due to misleading documentation. Localized messages are beneficial especially when your API returns exceptions. With this in mind, we aimed to simplify the process as much as possible and create a demo project for Spring 3, ensuring that even newcomers can grasp the concepts effortlessly.

## Before Starting

First of all, we need to create our resources bundle under `messages` folder.


```
src
|- main
|-- java
|-- resources
|--- messages
|----- messages.properties
|----- messages_tr.properties
|----- messages_en.properties
```
