![Managing Parameters in NiFi: HashiCorp Vault](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/izzetkalic/kalic.dev.public/refs/heads/main/blogs/images/2024.May_nifi-vault-integration_1.png)

Although I genuinely enjoy using Nifi, I find the parameter management and flow-file preview to be very problematic. The problem of parameter management is resolved by my other favorite tool. HashiCorp Vault was initially designed to be a secret manager that could hold all of your parameters and secrets. In this article we will clean the mess with Vault.

## Vault Configuration

I skipped the installation steps. The easiest installation is using Docker; however, be careful about the Vault host, which should be either an internal IP or a service name.

Firstly, proceed by selecting `kv` under the Secret Engines menu located in the main menu. A suitable path name should be given from the incoming page, and `Version: 1` should be selected in the Method Options section.

In the next step, a new secret should be created, and the values to be used should be entered into it. Here, since we will be using the Medium API, we will proceed by creating a `userId` and generating a personal access token as the `token`. You can access the API documentation from [here](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs).

## Nifi Configuration

Now that the Vault configuration is complete, let’s start by creating an empty processor group in NiFi. Assuming you have used NiFi before, we will proceed and use a simple InvokeHTTP processor to consume the Medium APIs.

Firstly, open the _Controller Settings > Parameter Providers_ section from the menu located in the top right corner of the main screen.

Here we will add a new provider, which we will select from the list: `HashiCorpVaultParameterProvider`. Then, using the edit button of the respective provider, navigate to the Properties menu. Here, as the Client Service, choose `StandartHashiCorpVaultClientService`(we can create a new one by selecting _Create New Service_). In the Key/Value Path section, we provide the name we gave when configuring the Vault. Put `.*` in the _Secret Name Pattern_ section, we can ensure that it pulls all the secrets we created. If you want to work with different secrets in different process groups, you can create a separate provider for each secret.

Then, write the values seen above into the newly created service. The value named `vault.token` does not normally appear, but you can create this value by clicking on the + button located in the top right corner. If you are using Docker, as mentioned above, you need to adjust the value entered in the _Host_ field. Save your changes, then click “Enable” to start the service.

Once all the configurations have been completed, select the provider created under Parameter Providers and click the _Fetch Parameter_ button. If there are no connection issues, you would see the values we created in Vault here.

The important thing to note here is whether the parameters need to be marked as _secrets_ within NiFi or not. Generally, the _Password_ fields used in database connections are marked as secrets. It is necessary to mark a value from Vault as secret during the Fetch Parameter process if you plan to use it in a password field of that type. This action cannot be reversed, so proceed with caution.

After that, all you need to do is right-click on the process group and select the _Process Group Parameter Context_ under the General Tab, then select new context that we created.

I defined the `userId` value in Vault since I had to write it to the publications endpoint as per the document I previously provided. Now, I can use this value in the processor as `#{userId}`. The parameter will be highlighted in blue when everything is correctly configured.

Lastly, I set the Bearer token to the value of the _Personal Access Token_ that I had retrieved from Medium.

Now you should be able to see the result when you run the _InvokeHTTP_ processor. *PS:* You should mark the _Response Generation_ parameter as true in the _InvokeHTTP_ properties.

What you saw in this article were only references to my parameters, not the actual parameters themselves. NiFi allows you to control parameters directly. In the same way, you can create parameter groups and provide distinct parameters for every process group, etc. Transferring these parameters to another NiFi instance or migrating them to a new NiFi installation is not simple, though. You must first export all parameters using the command-line interface (CLI) in order to accomplish this. Using Vault becomes quite beneficial at this point.
